    THIS IS PROBABLY NOT WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.  It is an RST generated
    version of some legacy work on the future CellML 1.2 spec.

    This document is an unofficial working draft. The below describes
    the intended status of the specification, and not the current status
    right now.

    This document specifies CellML 1.2, an XML-based language for
    describing and exchanging mathematical models.

    This is the *normative* specification of CellML. It is intended to
    provide the minimum amount of information needed to accurately
    describe CellML. An alternative version is available that is
    annotated with much more explanatory material.
